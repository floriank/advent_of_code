I had to heavily peek and ask for tips on this one, since I slept through my algorithms and data structures. What kicked me off was the approach by @mathsaey which also allowed me to use `Qex` and ultimately review approaches to finding nodes in a graph - which I was more than rusty at.

Second credit goes to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search :wink:
